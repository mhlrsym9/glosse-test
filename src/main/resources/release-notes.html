        <dd>Fix for CAD-481.  There was a turd left over from the switch over to using the B4X file name. We spent
            all the time examining the file name but ended up using the contents of the XML anyway. Doh!</dd>
    <dt><strong>04/19/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Fix for CAD-434.  We now account for multiple underscore (_) characters.</dd>
    <dt><strong>04/18/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Now use the B4X XML file name to determine where MARSOC IAT glossary content is located.  We used
        to use the name contained in the XML file, which cannot be counted on.</dd>
    <dt><strong>03/23/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Altered the algorithm that determines what is a phrase.  The new logic says that if any of the four
        punctuation marks are anywhere in the string, mark it as a phrase.  The old logic just looked at the first
        and last characters.</dd>
    <dt><strong>03/16/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>We have split off the sound pathing algorithm into two flavors: MARSOC and non-MARSOC.  For MARSOC, the content
        is expected to always be in alphabet/glossary so we build our paths based off of that assumption.  For non-MARSOC<
        we determine the location of the B4X folder and use that when we calculate the path.</dd>
    <dt><strong>03/10/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>We now calculate the expected path to the sound file based on the B4X folder location.  The unit number
            used in the referenced by tag is also calculated using the same algorithm.</dd>
    <dt><strong>03/03/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Log a warning message if any cards are detected that do not have any phrases.  It is an attempt to detect
            bad content files.</dd>
    <dt><strong>03/02/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>We now create a path to a sound file that includes the B4X directory.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/22/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>We now silently export a CSV file of the L1 data so Eszter can import the Gloss-E output into Excel.</dd>
        <dd>Fix for CAD-365: we now report referencing units at Unit 01 instead of PORbr_ENGus_01</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/17/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Each level of the viewer now contains a summation of the nodes below it.</dd>
        <dd>Added part-of-speech, referenced by and sound file to viewer.  Also put a word and phrase count summary
        into the the glossary viewer.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/16/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Fixed the glossary parser so it expects UTF-8 encoding.  This fixed the weird character issue on
            Windows.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/15/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Added a glossary previewer.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/11/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Display a dialog when the processing completes or fails.  Prior to the change, errors could happen
        and the user would never know enough to look in the developer messages window.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/10/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>The reset menu selection now works.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/09/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>You no longer have to hit the Enter key when supplying the file prefix or either suffix.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/08/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Re-enabled the suffix controls.  I got them to work correctly.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/07/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Can now control the stop words algorithm through the UI.</dd>
        <dd>Can now control the file prefix if you don't like the standard prefix of "glossary".</dd>
        <dd>Started wiring up the L1 and L2 suffix control but discovered that the engine does not
            properly support those features so I disabled them in the UI until somebody decides that
            they really need that support.</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/04/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Enabled the Help->Topics window.  The help contents still needs work.</dd>
        <dd>Enabled the Help->About window</dd>
        <dd>Support for custom configuration files</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/03/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Show the release version in the title bar</dd>
        <dd>Replaced the Go button with a big blue icon</dd>
        <dd>Disable the Go button until all required selections have been chosen</dd>
    <dt><strong>02/02/2011</strong></dt>
        <dd>Ability to install and update over the network</dd>
