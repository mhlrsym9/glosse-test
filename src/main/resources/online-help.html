        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Gloss-E is a Java-based tool which will scan the contents of a folder full of B4Xs and generate the files
        neccessary to drive Courseware's Glossary viewer.  At minimum, the user must know where the content folder is 
        located and where the generated files will be written to.</p>
        
        <h3>Required Information</h3>
        <p>The <em>Content Folder</em> is the location of the folder containing the B4Xs that are to be processed by the tool.
        The folder can either be local or on a network share.  The user must have read permissions for that folder or
        Gloss-E will not operate correctly.  The <em>destination folder</em> is the location where the files created by
        Gloss-E should be written.  The user must have write privledges to the directory or the tool will fail.</p>
        
        <h3>Optional Information</h3>
        <p>In most cases Gloss-E's built in configuration is sufficient and should be used.  In some cases, however, it
        is necessary to use an alternate configuration, usually for testing purposes.  Setting the <em>configuration file</em>
        property overrides Gloss-E's internal configuration and will attempt to use the file specified.  The file is expected
        to be in the same format as the internal file.  Using an incorrect configuration file will result in unpredictable
        results so contacting development for assistance in obtaining a configuration file is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>The <em>file prefix</em> is a way to control the names of the generated glossary files.  If nothing is
        is specified, then the Gloss-E will use the implied file name of <samp>glossary</samp>. If a prefix is provided,
        then the generated files will use that prefix instead of glossary.  For example, if I specify a prefix
        of <samp>B145X</samp> then the generated file names will be <samp>B145X_L1.xml</samp> and <samp>B145X_L2.xml</samp>
        instead of the default <samp>glossary_L1.xml</samp> and <samp>glossary_L2.xml</samp></p>

        <p>The <em>L1 suffix</em> and  <em>L2 suffix</em> control the last portion of the file name.  The suffix
        is appended after the file prefix, using an underscore <samp>_</samp> to separate the two.  For example, if I enter
        in <samp>ENGLISH</samp> as my L1 suffix and <samp>SPANISH</samp> as my L2 suffix, I will get the following
        files names: <samp>glossary_ENGLISH.xml</samp> and <samp>glossary_ENGLISH.xml</samp>.</p>

        <p>The <em>MARSOC support</em> option alters Gloss-E's processing so that part-of-speech information can be
        obtained by examining the name of the B4X folders.  The rule is that anything after the lesson number is to
        be considered to be a part-of-speech identifier.  For example, PORbr_ENGus_07_Verbs would specify that lesson
        07 contains words/phrases that are Verbs.  PORbr_ENGus_07_Verbs_and_Nouns would specify that lesson 07
        has Verbs and Nouns.  Gloss-E does not interpret the part-of-speech encoding and simply replaces the 
        underscores with blanks and uses that value when filling  in the part-of-speech tags in the generated XML.</p>
        <p>The <em>Stop Word Type</em> option controls how Gloss-E uses the stop word information contained in the
        configuration file.  A stop word is text that is ignored by Gloss-E when it attempts to determine how to organize
        the words/phrases being processed.  In English, for example, we might have <samp>the</samp> as stop word.  When
        Gloss-E encounters the phrase <samp>the door</samp>, it will group the phrase with phrases that begin with the letter
            <samp>d</samp>.  If we were to omit <samp>the</samp> from the stop word list, the phrase would be grouped with phrases that begin
        with the letter <samp>t</samp>.</p>

        <h3>Words, Phrases and Stop Words</h3>
        <p>One of Gloss-E's jobs is to organize the text that it finds into groups anchored by letters of the alphabet.
        For example, the word <samp>apple</samp> would be placed in the "words starting with the letter A" group.  In order to
        categorize the text, Gloss-E applies a few simple rules.  One rule it uses is the "phrase rule".  Gloss-E
        groups the text in one of two buckets: words or phrases.  Gloss-E looks at the first and last character of the
        text.  If either one of those characters is a period, exclamation point or question mark, the text is marked
        as being a phrase.  If the text is not a phrase, then it is treated as a word.</p>
        <p>Languages often have text that should be ignored when collating, such as <samp>the</samp> or <samp>of</samp>.
        Gloss-E's configuration file contains a section for each language that it knows about.  Each section has an
        area labeled <samp>stopWords</samp> which should probably have been labeled <samp>things to ignore</samp>.
        Gloss-E takes these stop words and uses it as an indication of what text should be ignored when analyzing
        the text.  Technically, the stop word string is a collection of regular expressions that indicate what text
        should be matched for "ignoring".  Although each language has its own set of stop words, a typical list looks
        like this:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>!</li>
            <li>?</li>
            <li>.</li>
            <li>,</li>
            <li>;</li>
            <li>:</li>
            <li>\</li>
            <li>-</li>
            <li>(</li>
            <li>)</li>
            <li>any digits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As an example, the text <samp>(a fish) shark</samp> would probably be seen by Gloss-E as <samp>fish shark</samp>
        because the two parens are ignored as well as the article <samp>a</samp>.  Additionally, Gloss-E sees everything as lowercase
        so <samp>FiSh</samp> and <samp>fish</samp> are the same.</p>

        <h3>Generating Glossary Files</h3>
        <p>Once all the required information has been provided, the "go" button will become enabled.  Once clicked,
        you should see progress messages in the window.  When the processing is complete a "done" message will 
        shown. You can also view a sub-set of the information contained in the generated files by accessing the
        Glossary View tab.</p>
